**Project Overview**

**Project Description**

In this project I have tried to showcase everything we learned in unit 1 of the General Assembly SEIR course. I employed a variety of HTML, vanilla CSS, vanilla javascript, and jquery to create a portfolio. The page starts with a header which uses a gif to provide  animation to the background. Below the navbar uses CSS to display dropdown menus on hover. The main information, hereafter referred to as “main”, incorporates an image of a bear (later to be replaced by my own) floated to the left of random text (later to be a description of myself). Below that a grid displays projects I created to advertise my talents and a description. If you click on the image it links to the project. At the bottom of the page, the footer includes links to my email and linkedin. The first project in the grid is an interactive stickman. The second is a weather API.
